      "story": "Once upon a time, there was a young shark named Finn, who was always curious about the world beyond the ocean's surface. One sunny afternoon, his curiosity got the best of him, and he decided to swim up to see what lay above the waves. As Finn popped his head above the water, he saw a magnificent sailboat gliding gracefully across the sea. Intrigued, he swam closer and, to his surprise, met a friendly sailor named Jack. Jack wasn’t afraid of Finn; instead, he threw him a few tasty fish. From that day on, Finn would swim up every morning to greet Jack, and together they shared stories—Jack about the land and Finn about the mysteries of the deep sea."
